# How to Play Tractor (升级拖拉机)

A guide for players new to Tractor, also known as Shengji ("Level Up").

## What is Tractor?

Tractor is a popular Chinese trick-taking card game played with **two standard decks** (108 cards including 4 jokers). It's played by **4 or 6 players** sitting in two teams. The goal is to advance your team's level from 2 all the way through Ace by winning rounds.

## Teams and Seating

Players sit in alternating team positions around the table:
- **4 players**: seats 0 and 2 vs seats 1 and 3
- **6 players**: seats 0, 2, and 4 vs seats 1, 3, and 5

Your teammates sit across from you, not next to you.

## Levels and Progression

Each team starts at level **2** and tries to reach level **Ace**. The progression is:

> 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10 → J → Q → K → A

Your current level determines your **level rank** — the rank that becomes special trump cards for the round. If your team is on level 5, all 5s are trump cards.

The first team to reach or pass Ace wins the game.

## The Banker

One player is the **banker** (庄家) each round. The banker's team is defending — they want to prevent the other team from scoring points. The non-banker team are the **defenders** trying to collect points.

## Card Points

Only three ranks are worth points:
| Card | Points |
|------|--------|
| 5    | 5      |
| 10   | 10     |
| K    | 10     |

All other cards are worth 0 points. Your team collects points by winning tricks that contain point cards.

## Trump Cards

Each round has a **trump suit** that beats all other suits. Trump cards include:
1. **Big Joker** (strongest card in the game)
2. **Small Joker**
3. All cards of the **level rank** (regardless of suit)
4. All cards of the **trump suit**

### Selecting Trump

During dealing, players can **flip** a level-rank card to propose a trump suit. Other players can **snatch** trump by showing a stronger combination. The strength order from weakest to strongest is:

> Single level card → Pair of level cards → Single Small Joker → Single Big Joker → Pair of Small Jokers → Pair of Big Jokers

To keep things fair, trump doesn't lock immediately — there's a short window (about 2 seconds) where others can counter with a stronger bid.

## The Kitty

After dealing, a few cards are set aside as the **kitty** (底牌). The banker gets to see the kitty, add it to their hand, and then **bury** the same number of cards face-down. These buried cards become important at the end of the round.

## Playing Tricks

The game is played in tricks, similar to Bridge or Hearts.

### Leading a Trick

The trick leader plays cards from their hand. They can lead:
- **Single**: one card
- **Pair**: two identical cards
- **Tractor**: two or more consecutive pairs (e.g., pair of 7s + pair of 8s)
- **Throw**: multiple singles/pairs/tractors of the same suit, but only if no opponent can beat any part of it

### Following a Trick

When someone else leads, you must follow these rules:
1. **Match the suit**: if you have cards in the led suit, you must play them
2. **Match the structure**: if a pair was led and you have a pair in that suit, you must play a pair; same for tractors
3. **If you're out of that suit**: you may play trump cards to try to win, or discard anything

### Who Wins the Trick?

- The highest card (or pattern) in the led suit wins, unless someone played trump
- Trump beats non-trump
- The trick winner leads the next trick

## Throws

A **throw** (甩牌) is when the leader plays multiple cards of the same suit at once (e.g., a single + a pair of spades). This is only allowed if no opponent can beat any individual part of the throw.

If an opponent *can* beat part of it, the throw is **punished** — the leader is forced to play only the weakest part instead.

## Scoring a Round

At the end of all tricks, points are totaled:

- **Kitty bonus**: if the defenders win the last trick, the points buried in the kitty are multiplied:
  - **2x** for a normal last-trick win
  - **4x** if the last trick was led with a pair or tractor

Then level-ups are determined by how many points the defenders collected:

| Defenders' Points | Result |
|-------------------|--------|
| Less than 80      | Banker's team levels up by 1 |
| 80–119            | Defenders level up by 1 |
| 120–159           | Defenders level up by 2 |
| 160+              | Defenders level up by 3 |

## Winning the Game

The first team to reach or pass level **Ace** wins. A strong round can jump you past multiple levels at once, so the game can end suddenly!

## Tips for New Players

- **Protect your point cards** — 10s and Ks are worth a lot. Don't throw them away on tricks you'll lose.
- **Remember trump is powerful** — use trump cards strategically to win tricks with lots of points.
- **Watch the kitty** — if your team can win the last trick, those kitty points get multiplied.
- **Coordinate with your teammate** — feed them point cards when they're winning tricks, and avoid competing against each other.
